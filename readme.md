## Introduction

This Bash script automates the creation of a Flutter project following Clean Architecture principles. It generates the folder structure and base files to help you develop modular and maintainable applications.

## Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) must be installed on your system.
- A Unix terminal (Linux or macOS) or [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on Windows.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) should be installed for version control.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Grant execution permissions to the script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x generate_flutter_clean_architecture.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./generate_flutter_clean_architecture.sh
   ```

2. Enter your Flutter project name when prompted:

   ```bash
   ðŸŽ¯ Flutter project name: my_project
   ```

3. The script will create a new Flutter project with the Clean Architecture structure.

## Project Structure

The script generates the following structure:

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ use_cases/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
```
